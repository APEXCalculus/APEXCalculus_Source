# README file for APEX Calculus

To compile, either compile Calculus.tex or Calculus1.tex. 
They are essentially the same, with the latter producing a smaller file with 
fewer chapters than "all" of calculus. 

The text is designed to run under XeLaTeX with the Calibri font. If you use regular 
pdflatex, it should still compile but there might be significant spacing issues in
 the printed text. This shouldn't matter when typesetting for HTML.

Direct questions/comments/suggestions to Gregory Hartman at hartmangn@vmi.edu.

Enjoy.
