APEXCalculus_Source
===================

Source files for the APEX Calculus text

The main file is Calculus.tex, intended to be run with XeLaTeX with the Calibri font. 
It will run without Calibri and with pdflatex, but the spacing will be different than intended.

CalculusI, CalculusII and CalculusIII each typeset a portion of the text. This is done mainly to get a different
TOC and exercise sets at the end. 

See "Version_2_errata.txt" for a list of known errors in the text. This will be updated continuously.
