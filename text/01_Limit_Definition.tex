This section introduces the formal definition of a limit, the ``epsilon--delta,'' or ``$\epsilon$--$\delta$,'' definition.\\

Before we give the actual definition, let's consider a few informal ways of describing a limit.  Given a function $y=f(x)$ and an $x$ value, call it $c$, we say that the limit of the function $f$ is a value~$L$: 

\begin{description}
\item[1.]if ``$y$ tends to $L$'' as ``$x$ tends to $c$.''
\item[2.]if ``$y$ approaches $L$'' as ``$x$ approaches $c$.''
\item[3.]if $y$ is \textit{near} $L$ whenever $x$ is \textit{near} $c$.
\end{description}

The problem with these definitions is that the words ``tends,'' ``approach,'' and especially ``near'' are not exact.  In what way does the variable $x$ tend to or approach $c$? How near do $x$ and $y$ have to be to $c$ and $L$, respectively?  \\

The definition we describe in this section comes from formalizing {\bf 3}.  A quick restatement gets us closer to what we want:

\begin{description}
\item[$\textbf{3}^\prime$.]If $x$ is within a certain \textit{tolerance level} of $c$, then the corresponding value $y=f(x)$ is within a certain \textit{tolerance level} of $L$.
\end{description}

The accepted notation for the $x$-tolerance is the lowercase Greek letter delta, or $\delta$, and the $y$-tolerance is lowercase epsilon, or $\epsilon$. One more rephrasing of $\textbf{3}^\prime$ nearly gets us to the actual definition:

\begin{description}
\item[$\textbf{3}^{\prime \prime}$.]If $x$ is within $\delta$ units of $c$, then the corresponding value of $y$ is within $\epsilon$ units of $L$.
\end{description}

Note that this means (let the ``$\longrightarrow$'' represent the word ``implies''):
$$
c - \delta < x < c + \delta \longrightarrow L - \epsilon < y < L + \epsilon 
\qquad \textrm{or} \qquad
|x - c| < \delta \longrightarrow  |y - L| < \epsilon 
$$
The point is that $\delta$ and $\epsilon$, being tolerances, can be any positive (but typically small) values.  Finally, we have the formal definition of the limit with the notation  seen in the previous section.

\definition{def:limit}{The Limit of a Function $f$}
{Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval containing $c$. The notation $$\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L,$$ read as ``the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $c$, is $L$,'' 
means that given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that 
whenever $|x - c| < \delta$, we have $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.
}

(Mathematicians often enjoy writing ideas without using any words. Here is the wordless definition of the limit:\\

$\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L \iff$
$\forall \, \epsilon > 0, \exists \, \delta > 0 \; s.t. \;
|x - c| < \delta \longrightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.)\\

There is an emphasis here that we may have passed over before.  In the definition, the $y$-tolerance $\epsilon$ is given \textit{first} and then the limit will exist {\bf if} we can find an $x$-tolerance $\delta$ that works.  

It is time for an example.  Note that the explanation is long, but it will take you through all steps necessary to understand the ideas.\\

\example{ex_compute_lim1}{\textbf{Evaluating a limit using the definition}\\
Show that $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 4} \sqrt{x} = 2 $.}
{Before we use the formal definition, let's try some numerical tolerances.  What if the $y$ tolerance is 0.5, or $\epsilon =0.5$?  How close to 4 does $x$ have to be so that $y$ is within 0.5 units of 2 (or $1.5 < y < 2.5$)?  In this case, we can just square these values to get
$1.5^2 < x < 2.5^2,$ or $$2.25 < x < 6.25.$$
So, what is the desired $x$ tolerance?  Remember, we want to find a symmetric interval of $x$ values, namely
$4 - \delta < x < 4 + \delta$.  The lower bound of $2.25$ is $1.75$ units from 4; the upper bound of 6.25 is 2.25 units from 4. We need the smaller of these two distances; we must have $\delta = 1.75$. See Figure \ref{fig:choose_e_d}.\\

Now read it in the correct way:  For the $y$ tolerance $\epsilon =0.5$, we have found an $x$ tolerance, $\delta = 1.75$, so that whenever $x$ is within $\delta$ units of 4, then $y$ is within $\epsilon$ units of 2.  That's what we were trying to find.\\
  
Let's try another value of $\epsilon$.\\

What if the $y$ tolerance is 0.01, or $\epsilon =0.01$?  How close to 4 does $x$ have to be in order for $y$ to be within 0.01 units of 2 (or $1.99 < y < 2.01$)?  Again, we just square these values to get
$1.99^2 < x < 2.01^2$, or $$3.9601 < x < 4.0401.$$  So, what is the desired $x$ tolerance?  In this case we must have $\delta = 0.0399$.  Note that in some sense, it looks like there are two tolerances (below 4 of 0.0399 units and above 4 of 0.0401 units).  However, we couldn't use the larger value of $0.0401$ for $\delta$ since then the interval for $x$ would be  $3.9599 < x < 4.0401$ resulting in $y$ values of $1.98995 < y < 2.01$ (which contains values NOT within 0.01 units of 2).\\

What we have so far: if $\epsilon =0.5$, then $\delta = 1.75$ and if $\epsilon =0.01$, then $\delta = 0.0399$. A pattern is not easy to see, so we switch to general $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ and do the calculations symbolically.  We start by assuming $y=\sqrt{x}$ is within $\epsilon$ units of 2:

\begin{eqnarray*}
|y - 2| < \epsilon &\\
-\epsilon < y - 2 < \epsilon& \qquad \textrm{(Definition of absolute value)}\\
-\epsilon < \sqrt{x} - 2 < \epsilon  &\qquad (y=\sqrt{x})\\
2 - \epsilon < \sqrt{x} < 2+ \epsilon &\qquad \textrm{ (Add 2)}\\
(2 - \epsilon)^2 < x < (2+ \epsilon) ^2 &\qquad \textrm{ (Square all)}\\
4 - 4\epsilon + \epsilon^2 < x < 4 + 4\epsilon + \epsilon^2 &\qquad \textrm{ (Expand)}\\
4 - (4\epsilon - \epsilon^2) < x < 4 + (4\epsilon + \epsilon^2) &\qquad \textrm{ (Rewrite in the desired form)}
\end{eqnarray*}

Since we want this last interval to describe an $x$ tolerance around 4, we have that either $\delta = 4\epsilon + \epsilon^2$ or $\delta = 4\epsilon - \epsilon^2$. However, as we saw in the case when $\epsilon = 0.01$, we want the smaller of the two values for $\delta$.  So, to conclude this part, we set
$\delta$ equal to the minimum of these two values, or $\delta = \min\{4\epsilon + \epsilon^2, 4\epsilon - \epsilon^2\}$.  Since $\epsilon > 0$, the minimum will occur when $\delta = 4\epsilon - \epsilon^2$.  That's the formula!  

We can check this for our previous values.  If $\epsilon=0.5$, the formula gives
$\delta = 4(0.5) - (0.5)^2 = 1.75$ and when $\epsilon=0.01$, the formula gives $\delta = 4(0.01) - (0.01)^2 = 0.399$.

So given any $\epsilon >0$, we can set $\delta = 4\epsilon - \epsilon^2$ and the limit definition is satisfied.  We have shown formally (and finally!) that $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 4} \sqrt{x} = 2 $.
}\\

%FOOTNOTE $**$: Actually, it is a pain, but this won't work if $\epsilon \ge 4$.  This shouldn't really occur since $\epsilon$ is supposed to be small, but it could happen.  In the cases where $\epsilon \ge 4$, just take $\delta = 1$ and you'll be fine.
 
If you are thinking this process is long, you would be right.  The previous example is also a bit unsatisfying in that $\sqrt{4}=2$; why work so hard to prove something so obvious? Many $\epsilon-\delta$ proofs are long and difficult to do. In this section, we will focus on examples where the answer is, frankly, obvious, because the non--obvious examples are even harder.  That is why theorems about limits are so useful! After doing a few more $\epsilon$--$\delta$ proofs, you will really appreciate the analytical ``short cuts'' found in the next section.\\

\example{ex_compute_lim2}{\textbf{Evaluating a limit using the definition}\\
Show that $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 2} x^2 = 4$.}
{Let's do this example symbolically from the start.  Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given; we want $|y-4| < \epsilon$, i.e.,  $|x^2-4| < \epsilon$.  How do we find $\delta$ such that when $|x-2| < \delta$, we are guaranteed that $|x^2-4|<\epsilon$?% for some $\delta$ (in terms of $\epsilon$)?

This is a bit trickier than the previous example, but let's start by noticing that 
$|x^2-4| = |x-2|\cdot|x+2|$.  Consider:\\
\begin{equation} |x^2-4| < \epsilon \longrightarrow |x-2|\cdot|x+2| < \epsilon \longrightarrow |x-2| < \frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}.\label{eq:limit1}\end{equation} 
Could we not set $\displaystyle \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}$?  

We are close to an answer, but the catch is that $\delta$ must be a \textit{constant} value (so it can't contain $x$).  There is a way to work around this, but we do have to make an assumption.  Remember that $\epsilon$ is supposed to be a small number, which implies that $\delta$ will also be a small value.  In particular, we can (probably) assume that $\delta < 1$.  If this is true, then $|x-2| < \delta$ would imply that $|x-2| < 1$, giving $1 < x < 3$.  

Now, back to the fraction $\displaystyle \frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}$.  If $1<x<3$, then $3<x+2<5$.  Taking reciprocals, we have $\displaystyle \frac{1}{5}<\frac{1}{|x+2|}<\frac{1}{3}$ so that, in particular, 
\begin{equation} \frac{\epsilon}{5}<\frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}.\label{eq:limit2}\end{equation}  
This suggests that we set 
$\displaystyle \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{5}$. To see why, let's go back to the equations:

\small
\begin{eqnarray*}
|x - 2| < \delta &\\
|x - 2| < \frac{\epsilon}{5}& \qquad \text{\small(Our choice of $\delta$)}\\
|x - 2|\cdot|x + 2| < |x + 2|\cdot\frac{\epsilon}{5}& \qquad \text{\small(Multiply by $|x+2|$)}\\
|x^2 - 4|< |x + 2|\cdot\frac{\epsilon}{5}& \qquad \text{\small(Combine left side)}\\
|x^2 - 4|< |x + 2|\cdot\frac{\epsilon}{5} <|x + 2|\cdot\frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}=\epsilon & \qquad 
\text{\small(Using (\ref{eq:limit2}) as long as $\delta <1$)}
\end{eqnarray*}
\normalsize

We have arrived at $|x^2 - 4|<\epsilon$ as desired.  Note again, in order to make this happen we needed $\delta$ to first be less than 1.  That is a safe assumption; we want $\epsilon$ to be arbitrarily small, forcing $\delta$ to also be small. 

We have also picked $\delta$ to be smaller than ``necessary.'' We could get by with a slightly larger $\delta$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:limit_eover5}. The dashed, red lines show the boundaries defined by our choice of $\epsilon$. The gray, dashed lines show the boundaries defined by setting $\delta = \epsilon/5$. Note how these gray lines are within the red lines. That is perfectly fine; by choosing $x$ within the gray lines we are guaranteed that $f(x)$ will be within $\epsilon$ of 4.%If the value we eventually used for $\delta$, namely $\epsilon/5$, is not less than 1, this proof won't work.  For the final fix, we instead set $\delta$ to be the minimum of 1 and $\epsilon/5$. This way all calculations above work.  

\mfigure{.75}{Choosing $\delta = \epsilon/5$ in Example \ref{ex_compute_lim2}.}{fig:limit_eover5}{figures/figLimitProof2a}

In summary, given $\epsilon > 0$, set $\delta=\epsilon/5$.  Then $|x - 2| < \delta$ implies 
$|x^2 - 4|< \epsilon$ (i.e. $|y - 4|< \epsilon$) as desired.  We have shown that $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 2} x^2 = 4 $. Figure \ref{fig:limit_eover5} gives a visualization of this; by restricting $x$ to values within $\delta = \epsilon/5$ of 2, we see that $f(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ of $4$.

%Examples \ref{ex_compute_lim1} and \ref{ex_compute_lim2} determine $\delta$ by using logic that is difficult to recreate as one learns this topic. For instance, Equation \eqref{eq:limit2} is used based on the following facts:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item		We want $\delta \leq \frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}$. Since we cannot let $\delta$ vary according to $x$,
%	\item		we notice that $|x+2|<5$ for the values we are interested in, so
%	\item		$\frac{\epsilon}{5} < \frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}$ and setting $\delta<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$ ensures that $\delta<\frac{\epsilon}{|x+2|}$.
%	\end{enumerate}
%
%The following theorem offers some inequalities that are useful when creating $\delta$--$\epsilon$ proofs.
%
%\theorem{thm:power_ineq}{Power Function Inequalities}
%{Let $x>y>0$ and $n>1$. The following inequalities hold:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item		$\ds x^n+y^n < (x+y)^n$
%\item		$\ds (x-y)^n < x^n - y^n$
%\item		$\ds\sqrt[n]{x+y} < \sqrt[n]{x}+\sqrt[n]{y}$
%\item		$\ds \sqrt[n]{x}-\sqrt[n]{y}<\sqrt[n]{x-y}$

%
%We revisit the limit found in Example \ref{ex_compute_lim2} to demonstrate the use of Theorem \ref{thm:power_ineq}.
%
%\example{ex_compute_lim2b}{Show that $\ds \lim_{x\to 2} x^2=4$ using Theorem \ref{thm:power_ineq}.}
%{We start the same as before; let $\epsilon >0$ be given. We want to find $\delta>0$ such that $|x^2-4|<\epsilon$ whenever $|x-2|<\delta$. Consider the following inequalities:
%\begin{align*}
%|x^2-4|<\epsilon & \\
%-\epsilon < x^2-4 < \epsilon & \qquad \text{\small (Definition of abs. value)}\\

%2-\sqrt{\epsilon} < x < 2 + \sqrt{\epsilon} & \text{\small (Simplify)}
%\end{align*}
%This implies that when $x$ is within $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ of $2$, $x^2$ will be within $\epsilon$ of $4$. Thus set $\delta = \sqrt{\epsilon}$. We can now start with $|x-2|<\delta$ and reverse the above steps:
%\begin{align*}
%|x-2| < \delta & \\
%-\delta < x-2 < \delta & \qquad \text{\small (Definition of abs. value)}\\

\example{ex_compute_lim3}{\textbf{Evaluating a limit using the definition}\\Show that $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} e^x = 1 $.}
{Symbolically, we want to take the equation $|e^x - 1| < \epsilon$ and unravel it to the form $|x-0| < \delta$.  Let's look at some calculations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
|e^x - 1| < \epsilon&\\
-\epsilon < e^x - 1 < \epsilon& \qquad \textrm{(Definition of absolute value)}\\
1-\epsilon < e^x < 1+\epsilon & \qquad \textrm{(Add 1)}\\
\ln(1-\epsilon) < x < \ln(1+\epsilon) & \qquad \textrm{(Take natural logs)}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Making the safe assumption that $\epsilon<1$ ensures the last inequality is valid (i.e., so that $\ln (1-\epsilon)$ is defined). We can then set $\delta$ to be the minimum of $|\ln(1-\epsilon)|$ and $\ln(1+\epsilon)$; i.e.,  %  Well, there is a catch.  The value of $\epsilon$ is supposed to be small, but if it happens that $\epsilon \ge 1$, then $\ln(1-\epsilon)$ would be undefined!  The way to work around this is to simply define a new epsilon that is guaranteed to be smaller than the original epsilon \textit{and} less than 1 (let's say less than 1/2 just to be on the safe side).  Let's call this new value $\epsilon_1$ and define it to be $\epsilon_1 = \min\{\epsilon, 1/2\}$.  Then we can use the calculations above to define 
$$\delta = \min\{|\ln(1-\epsilon)|, \ln(1+\epsilon)\}.$$  
\mnote{.5}{\textbf{Note:} Recall $\ln 1= 0$ and $\ln x<0$ when $0<x<1$. So $\ln (1-\epsilon) <0$, hence we consider its absolute value.}

Now, we work through the actual the proof:


\begin{eqnarray*}
|x - 0|<\delta\\
-\delta < x < \delta& \qquad \textrm{(Definition of absolute value)}\\
\ln(1-\epsilon) < x < \ln(1+\epsilon) & \qquad \textrm{(By our choice of}\; \delta)\\
1-\epsilon < e^x < 1+\epsilon & \qquad \textrm{(Exponentiate)}\\
-\epsilon < e^x - 1 < \epsilon & \qquad \textrm{(Subtract 1)}\\
%-\epsilon < e^x - 1 < \epsilon & \qquad \textrm{(Since}\; \epsilon_1 \le \epsilon)\\
\end{eqnarray*}

In summary, given $\epsilon > 0$, let $\delta = \min\{|\ln(1-\epsilon |, \ln(1+\epsilon)\}$. Then $|x - 0| < \delta$ implies $|e^x - 1|< \epsilon$ as desired.  We have shown that $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} e^x = 1 $.
}\\

We note that we could actually show that $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} e^x = e^c $ for any constant $c$.  We do this by factoring out $e^c$ from both sides, leaving us to show $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} e^{x-c} = 1 $ instead.  By using the substitution $y=x-c$, this reduces to showing $\lim_{y\rightarrow 0} e^y = 1 $ which we just did in the last example.  As an added benefit, this shows that in fact the function $f(x)=e^x$ is \textit{continuous} at all values of $x$, an important concept we will define in Section \ref{sec:continuity}.\\
