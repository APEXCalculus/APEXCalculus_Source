{Explain the how the units of volume are found in the integral of Theorem \ref{thm:volume_by_cross_section}: if $A(x)$ has units of in$^2$, how does $\int A(x)\ dx$ have units of in$^3$?}
{Recall that ``$dx$'' does not just ``sit there;'' it is multiplied by $A(x)$ and represents the thickness of a small slice of the solid. Therefore $dx$ has units of in, giving $A(x)\ dx$ the units of in$^3$.}
