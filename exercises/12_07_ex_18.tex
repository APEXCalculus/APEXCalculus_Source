{$\ds f(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$

{
One critical point: $f_x = 0$ when $x=0$; $f_y = 0$ when $y = 0$, so one critical point at $(0,0)$ (although it should be noted that at $(0,0)$, both $f_x$ and $f_y$ are undefined.) The Second Derivative Test fails at $(0,0)$, with $D=0$. A graph, or simple calculation, shows that $(0,0)$ is the absolute minimum of $f$.
