{\noindent In Exercises}
{, a function $z=f(x,y)$ and a point $P$ are given. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] Find the direction of maximal increase of $f$ at $P$.
	\item [(b)] What is the maximal value of $D_{\vec u\,}f$ at $P$?
	\item [(c)] Find the direction of minimal increase of $f$ at $P$.
	\item	[(d)] Give a direction $\vec u$ such that $D_{\vec u\,}f=0$ at $P$.
\end{enumerate}
Note: these are the same functions and points as in Exercises \ref{12_05_ex_11} through \ref{12_05_ex_23}.
