{Pick a integer value for $n$, where $n\neq 2,3$, and use technology to plot $\ds r=\sin\left(\frac mn\theta\right)$ for three different integer values of $m$. Sketch these and determine a minimal interval on which the entire graph is shown.}
{Answers will vary. If $m$ and $n$ do not have any common factors, then an interval of $2n\pi$ is needed to sketch the entire graph.
