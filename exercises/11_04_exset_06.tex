{ , a position function $\vrt$ is given along with its unit tangent vector $\vec T(t)$ evaluated at $t=a$, for some value of $a$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] Confirm that $\vec T(a)$ is as stated.
	\item	[(b)] Using a graph of \vrt\ and Theorem \ref{thm:concave}, find $\vec N(a)$.
\end{enumerate}
