{A cylindrical storage tank is to be 2ft tall with a radius of 1ft. Is the volume of the tank more sensitive to changes in the radius or the height?
}
{The total differential of volume is $dV = 4\pi dr + \pi dh$. The coefficient of $dr$ is greater than the coefficient of $dh$, so the volume is more sensitive to changes in the radius.
