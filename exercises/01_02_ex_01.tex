{What is wrong with the following ``definition'' of a limit?
	\begin{quote}
``The limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $a$, is $K$'' means that given any $\delta>0$ there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that whenever $|f(x)-K|< \epsilon$, we have $|x-a|<\delta$.
	\end{quote}
}
{$\epsilon$ should be given first, and the restriction 	$|x-a|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-K|< \epsilon$, not the other way around.}
