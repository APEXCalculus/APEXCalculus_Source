Suppose the man stands directly next to the weight (i.e., a total rope length of 60 ft) and begins to walk away at a rate of 2ft/s. How fast is the weight rising when the man has walked:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	10 feet?
\item	40 feet?
\end{enumerate}
How far must the man walk to raise the weight all the way to the pulley?
}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $0.63$ ft/sec
\item	 $1.6$ ft/sec
\end{enumerate}
About 52 ft.
