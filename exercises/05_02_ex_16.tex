{An object is thrown straight up with a velocity, in ft/s, given by $v(t) = -32t+64$, where $t$ is in seconds, from a height of 48 feet.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		What is the object's maximum velocity?
\item		What is the object's maximum displacement?
\item		When does the maximum displacement occur?
\item		When will the object reach a height of 0? (Hint: find when the displacement is $-48$ft.)
\end{enumerate}

}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		64ft/s
\item		64ft
\item		$t=2$
\item		$t=2+\sqrt{7}\approx 4.65$ seconds
\end{enumerate}
