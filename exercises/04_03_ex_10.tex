{Find the dimensions of a cylindrical can with a volume of 206in$^3$ that minimizes the surface area.

The ``\#10 can''is a standard sized can used by the restaurant industry that holds about 206in$^3$ with a diameter of 6 2/16in and height of 7in. Does it seem these dimensions where chosen with minimization in mind?
}
{The radius should be about $3.2$in and the height should be $2r=6.4$in. As the \#10 is not a perfect cylinder (with extra material to aid in stacking, etc.), the dimensions are close enough to assume that minimizing surface area was a consideration.
