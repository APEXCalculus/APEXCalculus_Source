{An inverted cylindrical cone, 20ft deep and 10ft across at the top, is being filled with water at a rate of 10ft$^3$/min. At what rate is the water rising in the tank when the depth of the water is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	1 foot?
\item	10 feet?
\item	19 feet?
\end{enumerate}
How long will the tank take to fill when starting at empty?
}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $50.92$ ft/min
\item	 $0.509$ ft/min
\item  $0.141$ ft/min
\end{enumerate}
As the tank holds about 523.6ft$^3$, it will take about 52.36 minutes.
