{A company that produces landscaping materials is dumping sand into a conical pile. The sand is being poured at a rate of 5ft$^3$/sec; the physical properties of the sand, in conjunction with gravity, ensure that the cone's height is roughly 2/3 the length of the diameter of the circular base. 

How fast is the cone rising when it has a height of 30 feet?
}
{The cone is rising at a rate of $0.003$ft/s.
