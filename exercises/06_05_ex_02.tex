{The hyperbolic functions are used to define points on the right hand portion of the hyperbola $x^2-y^2=1$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hfcircle}. How can we use the hyperbolic functions to define points on the left hand portion of the hyperbola?}
{The points on the left hand side can be defined as $(-\cosh x, \sinh x)$.}
