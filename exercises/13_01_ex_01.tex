{When integrating $f_x(x,y)$ with respect to $x$, the constant of integration $C$ is really which: $C(x)$ or $C(y)$? What does this mean?}
{$C(y)$, meaning that instead of being just a constant, like the number 5, it is a function of $y$, which acts like a constant when taking derivatives with respect to $x$.
