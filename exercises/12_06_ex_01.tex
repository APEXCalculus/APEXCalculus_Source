{Explain how the vector $\vec v=\la 1,0,3\ra$ can be thought of as having a ``slope'' of 3.
}
{
Answers will vary. The displacement of the vector is one unit in the $x$-direction and 3 units in the $z$-direction, with no change in $y$. Thus along a line parallel to $\vec v$, the change in $z$ is 3 times the change in $x$ -- i.e., a ``slope'' of 3. Specifically, the line in the $x$-$z$ plane parallel to $z$ has a slope of 3.
