{A power line is to be run to an offshore facility in the manner described in Example \ref{ex_opt3}. The offshore facility is 5 miles at sea and 2 miles along the shoreline from the power plant. It costs \$50,000 per mile to lay a power line underground and \$80,000 to run the line underwater. 

How much of the power line should be run underground to minimize the overall costs?
}
{The power line should be run directly to the off shore facility, skipping any underground, giving a cost of about \$430,813.
