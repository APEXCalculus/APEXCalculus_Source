{What is the difference between the radius of convergence and the interval of convergence?
}
{The radius of convergence is a \sword{value} $R$ such that a power series, centered at $x=c$, converges for all values of $x$ in $(c-R,c+R)$. The interval of convergence is an \sword{interval} on which the power series converges; it may differ from $(c-R,c+R)$ only at the endpoints.
