{A football quarterback throws a pass from a height of 6ft, intending to hit his receiver 20yds away at a height of 5ft.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] If the ball is thrown at a rate of 50mph, what angle of elevation is needed to hit his intended target?
	\item [(b)] If the ball is thrown at with an angle of elevation of $8^\circ$, what initial ball speed is needed to hit his target?
\end{enumerate}
}
{The position function of the ball is $\vrt = \la (v_0\cos\theta)t,-16t^2+(v_0\sin\theta)t+6\ra$, where $\theta$ is the angle of elevation and $v_0$ is the initial ball speed.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item With $v_0 = 73.33$ft/s, there are two angles of elevation possible. An angle of $\theta = 9.47^\circ$ delivers the ball in 0.83s, while an angle of $79.57^\circ$ delivers the ball in $4.5$s.
	\item	With $\theta=8^\circ$, the initial speed must be 53.8mph$\approx 78.9$ft/s.
	
\end{enumerate}
