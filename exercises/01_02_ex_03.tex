{$\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2} 5 = 5$}
{Let $\epsilon >0$ be given. We wish to find $\delta >0$ such that when $|x-2|<\delta$, $|f(x)-5|<\epsilon$. However, since $f(x)=5$, a constant function, the latter inequality is simply $|5-5|<\epsilon$, which is always true. Thus we can choose any $\delta$ we like; we arbitrarily choose $\delta =\epsilon$.
