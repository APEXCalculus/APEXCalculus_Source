{The graph of $f(x)=x^2-1$ is shown. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		Use the graph to approximate the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at the following points: $(-1,0)$, $(0,-1)$ and $(2,3)$. 
	\item		Using the definition, find $\fp(x)$.
	\item		Find the slope of the tangent line at the points $(-1,0)$, $(0,-1)$ and $(2,3)$.
	\end{enumerate}

}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item	Approximations will vary; they should match (c) closely.
\item		$\fp(x) = 2x$
\item		At $(-1,0)$, slope is $-2$. At $(0,-1)$, slope is 0. At $(2,3)$, slope is 4.
\end{enumerate}
