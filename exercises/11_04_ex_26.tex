{$\vrt = \la 5\cos t,4\sin t, 3\sin t \ra$ on $[0,2\pi]$; consider $t=0$ and $t=\pi/2$.
}
{$a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 5$\\
At $t=0$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 5$;\\
At $t=\pi/2$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 5$.\\
The object moves at constant speed, meaning that $a_{\text{T}}$ is always 0. Acceleration is thus always perpendicular to the direction of travel; in this particular case, it is always 5 times the unit vector pointing orthogonal to the direction of travel.
