{Consider the situation described in Exercise \ref{exer:04_02_ex_12}. Suppose the man starts 40ft from the weight and begins to walk away at a rate of 2ft/s. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item	How long is the rope?
\item	How fast is the weight rising after the man has walked 10 feet?
\item	How fast is the weight rising after the man has walked 40 feet?
\item	How far must the man walk to raise the weight all the way to the pulley?
\end{enumerate}
