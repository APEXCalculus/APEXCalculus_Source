{A Cessna flies at 1000ft at 150mph and drops a box of supplies to the professor (and his wife) on an island. Ignoring wind resistance, how far horizontally will the supplies travel before they land? 
}
{The position function is $\vrt = \la 220t,-16t^2+1000\ra$. The $y$-component is 0 when $t=7.9$; $\vec r(7.9) = \la 1739.25,0\ra$, meaning the box will travel about 1740ft horizontally before it lands.
