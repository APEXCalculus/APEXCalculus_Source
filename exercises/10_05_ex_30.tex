{Let lines $\ell_1(t)$ and $\ell_2(t)$ be intersecting lines. Show why the distance formula correctly gives the distance between these lines as $0$.\label{10_05_ex_30}
}
{(Note: this solution is easier once one has studied Section \ref{sec:planes}.) Since the two lines intersect, we can state $P_2= P_1 + a\vec d_1+b\vec d_2$ for some scalars $a$ and $b$. (Here we abuse notation slightly and add points to vectors.) Thus $\vv{P_1P_2} = a\vec d_1+b\vec d_2$. Vector $\vec c$ is the cross product of $\vec d_1$ and $\vec d_2$, hence is orthogonal to both, and hence is orthogonal to $\vv{P_1P_2}$. Thus $\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot\vec c = 0$, and the distance between lines is $0$.
