	\item The officer is traveling due north at 50mph and is 1/2 mile from the intersection, while the other car is 1 mile from the intersection traveling west and the radar reading is $-80$mph?
	\item The officer is traveling due north at 50mph and is 1 mile from the intersection, while the other car is 1/2 mile from the intersection traveling west and the radar reading is $-80$mph?
	\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
	\item $64.44$ mph
