{Why does Key Idea \ref{idea:trigsub}(a) state that $\sqrt{a^2-x^2} = a\cos\theta$, and not $|a\cos\theta|$?
}
{Because we are considering $a>0$ and $x=a\sin \theta$, which means $\theta = \sin^{-1}(x/a)$. The arcsine function has a domain of $-\pi/2\leq \theta \leq \pi/2$; on this domain, $\cos \theta \geq 0$, so $a\cos\theta$ is always non-negative, allowing us to drop the absolute value signs.
