{How is Exercise \ref{10_05_ex_30} in Section \ref{sec:lines} easier to answer once we have an understanding of planes?
}
{The intersecting lines define a plane with normal vector $\vec n = \vec c = \vec d_1\times \vec d_2$. Since points $P_1$ and $P_2$ lie in the plane, $\vec c$ is orthogonal to $\vv{P_1P_2}$, hence $\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot\vec c = 0$, giving a distance of 0. Knowing the principles of planes, especially their normal vectors, makes this simpler.
