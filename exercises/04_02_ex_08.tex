{An F-22 aircraft is flying at 500mph with an elevation of  100ft on a straight--line path that will take it directly over an anti--aircraft gun as in Exercise \ref{exer:04_02_ex_07} (note the lower elevation here).

How fast must the gun be able to turn to accurately track the aircraft when the plane is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	1000 feet away?
\item	100 feet away?
\item	Directly overhead?
\end{enumerate}
}
{Due to the height of the plane, the gun does not have to rotate very fast.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $0.073$ rad/s
\item	$3.66$ rad/s (about 1/2 revolution/sec)
\item In the limit, rate goes to $7.33$ rad/s (more than 1 revolution/sec)
\end{enumerate}
}
