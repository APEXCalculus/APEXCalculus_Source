{Suppose $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ is convergent, and there are sequences $\{b_n\}$ and $\{c_n\}$ such that $b_n \leq a_n \leq c_n$ for all $n$. What can be said about the series $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$ and $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n$?
}
{$\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$ converges; we cannot conclude anything about $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n$
