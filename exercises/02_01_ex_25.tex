{The graph of $\ds f(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}$ is shown. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		Use the graph to approximate the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at the following points: $(0,1)$ and $(1,0.5)$. 
	\item		Using the definition, find $\fp(x)$.
	\item		Find the slope of the tangent line at the points $(0,1)$ and $(1,0.5)$.
	\end{enumerate}

}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item	Approximations will vary; they should match (c) closely.
\item		$\fp(x) = -1/(x+1)^2$
\item		At $(0,1)$, slope is $-1$. At $(1,0.5)$, slope is $-1/4$.
\end{enumerate}
