{$a_{\text{T}} = 2$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 4t^2$\\
At $t=\sqrt{\pi/2}$, $a_{\text{T}} = 2$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 2\pi$;\\
At $t=\sqrt{\pi}$, $a_{\text{T}} = 2$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 4\pi$.\\
The object moves at increasing speed (increasing at a constant rate of acceleration), hence $a_{\text{T}}=2$. Since the object is increasing speed yet always traveling in a circle of radius 1, the direction must change more quickly; the amount of acceleration that changes direction increases over time.
