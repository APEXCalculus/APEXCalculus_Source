{Describe a scenario where an object's average speed is a large number, but the magnitude of the average velocity is not a large number.
}
{
One example is traveling at a constant speed $s$ in a circle, ending at the starting position. Since the displacement is $\vec 0$, the average velocity is $\vec 0$, hence $\vnorm 0=0$. But traveling at constant speed $s$ means the average speed is also $s >0$.
