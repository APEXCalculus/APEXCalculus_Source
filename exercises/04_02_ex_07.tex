{\label{exer:04_02_ex_07}An F-22 aircraft is flying at 500mph with an elevation of  10,000ft on a straight--line path that will take it directly over an anti--aircraft gun. 

\myincludegraphics{figures/fig04_02_ex_07}

How fast must the gun be able to turn to accurately track the aircraft when the plane is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	1 mile away?
\item	1/5 mile away?
\item	Directly overhead?
\end{enumerate}
}
{Due to the height of the plane, the gun does not have to rotate very fast.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $0.0573$ rad/s
\item	$0.0725$ rad/s
\item In the limit, rate goes to $0.0733$ rad/s
\end{enumerate}
}
