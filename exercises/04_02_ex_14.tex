{A hot air balloon lifts off from ground rising vertically. From 100 feet away, a 5' woman tracks the path of the balloon. When her sightline with the balloon makes a 45$^\circ$ angle with the horizontal, she notes the angle is increasing at about 5$^\circ$/min. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item		What is the elevation of the balloon?
\item		How fast is it rising?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item		The balloon is 105ft in the air.
\item  The balloon is rising at a rate of 17.45ft/min. (Hint: convert all angles to radians.)
\end{enumerate}
