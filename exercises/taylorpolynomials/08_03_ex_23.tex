{Find $n$ such that the  Maclaurin polynomial of degree $n$ of $f(x)= \sin x$ approximates $\cos \pi$ within $0.0001$ of the actual value.
}
{The $n^\text{th}$ derivative of $f(x)=\sin x$ is bounded by $1$ on intervals containing $0$ and $\pi$. Thus $|R_n(\pi)|\leq \frac{1}{(n+1)!}(\pi)^{(n+1)}$. When $n=12$, this is less than $0.0001$. Since the Maclaurin polynomial of $\sin x$ only uses odd powers, we can actually just use $n=11$.
