{Approximate $\sqrt{10}$ with the Taylor polynomial of degree 2 centered at $x=9$.

{$p_2(x) =3+\frac{1}{6} (-9+x)-\frac{1}{216} (-9+x)^2$; $p_2(10) =  3.16204$. The third derivative of $f(x) =\sqrt x$ is bounded on $(8,11)$ by $0.003$. Error is bounded by $\pm \frac{0.003}{3!}\cdot1^3 = \pm 0.0005.$
