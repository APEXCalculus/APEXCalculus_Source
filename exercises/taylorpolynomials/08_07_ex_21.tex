{Find $n$ such that the  Maclaurin polynomial of degree $n$ of $f(x)= e^x$ approximates $e$ within $0.0001$ of the actual value.
}
{The $n^\text{th}$ derivative of $f(x)=e^x$ is bounded by $3$ on intervals containing $0$ and 1. Thus $|R_n(1)|\leq \frac{3}{(n+1)!}1^{(n+1)}$. When $n=7$, this is less than $0.0001$.
