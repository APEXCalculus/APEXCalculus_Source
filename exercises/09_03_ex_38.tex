{A common approximate of the circumference of an ellipse given by $x=a\cos t$,\quad $y=b\sin t$ is $\ds C\approx 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^2+b^2}2}$. Use this formula to approximate the circumference of $x=5\cos t$, \quad $y=3\sin t$ and compare this to the approximation given by  Simpson's Rule and $n=6$.}
{Formula: $C\approx 25.9062$; Simpson's Rule: $C\approx 25.4786$ (actual value: $C=25.527$) }
