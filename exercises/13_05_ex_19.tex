{Let $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)=2f(x,y)$. Why is the surface area of $g$ over a region $R$ not twice the surface area of $f$ over $R$?
}
{Analytically, $g_x = 2f_x$ and $g_y=2f_y$. The double integral to compute the surface area of $f$ over $R$ is $\ds \iint_R \sqrt{1+f_x^2+f_y^2}\ dA$; the double integral to compute the surface area of $g$ over $R$ is $\ds \iint_R\sqrt{1+4f_x^2+4f_y^2}\ dA$, which is \textit{not} twice the double integral used to calculate the surface area of $f$.
