{The distance, in feet, a stone drops in $t$ seconds is given by $d(t) = 16t^2$. The depth of a hole is to be approximated by dropping a rock and listening for it to hit the bottom. What is the propagated error if the time measurement is accurate to $2/10^{\text{ths}}$ of a second and the measured time is:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item 2 seconds?
	\item	5 seconds?
	\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		$\pm$12.8 feet
\item		$\pm$32 feet
\end{enumerate}
}
