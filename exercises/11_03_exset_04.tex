{\noindent In Exercises}
{ , position functions $\vec r_1(t)$ and $\vec r_2(s)$ for two objects are given that follow the same path on the respective intervals.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [(a)] Show that the positions are the same at the indicated $t_0$ and $s_0$ values; i.e., show $\vec r_1(t_0) = \vec r_2(s_0).$
		\item	[(b)] Find the velocity, speed and acceleration of the two objects at $t_0$ and $s_0$, respectively.
	\end{enumerate}
