{A loud sound is recorded at three stations that lie on a line as shown in the figure below. Station $A$ recorded the sound 1 second after Station $B$, and Station $C$ recorded the sound 3 seconds after $B$. Using the speed of sound as 340m/s, determine the location of the sound's origination.

{The sound originated from a point approximately 31m to the left of $B$ and 1340m above it.
