{A boy whirls a ball, attached to a  3ft string, above his head in a counter--clockwise circle. The ball makes 2 revolutions per second.

At what $t$-values should the boy release the string so that the ball heads directly for a tree standing 10ft in front of him?
}
{At $t$-values of $\sin^{-1}(9/30)/(4\pi) + n/2 \approx 0.024 + n/2$ seconds, where $n$ is an integer.
