{Why do $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)=f(x,y)+h$, for some real number $h$, have the same surface area over a region $R$? 
}
{Intuitively, adding $h$ to $f$ only shifts $f$ up (i.e., parallel to the $z$-axis) and does not change its shape. Therefore it will not change the surface area over $R$. 

Analytically, $f_x = g_x$ and $f_y=g_y$; therefore, the surface area of each is computed with identical double integrals.
