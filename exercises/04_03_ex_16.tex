{A woman throws a stick into a lake for her dog to fetch; the stick is 15 feet down the shore line and 30 feet into the water from there. The dog may jump directly into the water and swim, or run along the shore line to get closer to the stick before swimming. The dog runs about 22ft/s and swims about 1.5ft/s. 

How far along the shore should the dog run to minimize the time it takes to get to the stick? \textit{\footnotesize (Google ``calculus dog'' to learn more about a dog's ability to minimize times.)}
}
{The dog should run about 13 feet along the shore before starting to swim.
