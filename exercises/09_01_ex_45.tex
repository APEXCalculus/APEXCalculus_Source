{Explain how one can quickly look at the equation of a hyperbola in standard form and determine whether the transverse axis is horizontal or vertical.
}
{With a horizontal transverse axis, the $x^2$ term has a positive coefficient; with a vertical transverse axis, the $y^2$ term has a positive coefficient.
