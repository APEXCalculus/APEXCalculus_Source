{\noindent In Exercises}
{, an implicitly defined function of $x$, $y$ and $z$ is given along with a point $P$ that lies on the surface. Use the gradient $\nabla F$ to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] find the equation of the normal line to the surface at $P$, and
	\item	[(b)] find the equation of the plane tangent  to the surface at $P$.
\end{enumerate}
