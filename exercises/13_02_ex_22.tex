{$\ds \int_{-1}^{1}\int_1^{2} \frac{x\tan^2y}{1+\ln y}\ dy\ dx$
}
{Integrating in the order shown is hard/impossible. By changing the order of integration, we have $\ds \int_{1}^{2}\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{x\tan^2y}{1+\ln y}\ dx\ dy = 0$, since the integrand is an odd function with respect to $x$. Thus the iterated integral evaluates to 0.
