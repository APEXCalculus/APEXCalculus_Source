{A conical water tank is 5 m deep with a top radius of 3 m. (This is similar to Example \ref{ex_pump2}.) The tank is filled with pure water, with a mass density of 1000 kg/m$^3$. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		Find the work performed in pumping all the water to the top of the tank.
	\item		Find the work performed in pumping the top 2.5 m of water to the top of the tank.
	\item		Find the work performed in pumping the top half of the water, by volume, to the top of the tank.
	\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item	577,268 j
\item	398,872 j
\item	110,111 j  (By volume, half of the water is between the base of the cone and a height of 3.9685 m. If one rounds this to 4 m, the work is 104,476 j.)
\end{enumerate}
