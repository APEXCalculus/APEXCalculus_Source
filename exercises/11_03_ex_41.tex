{An object with position function $\vrt = \la 5\cos t,-5\sin t\ra$, where distances are measured in feet and time is in seconds, on $[0,\pi]$.
}
{Displacement: $\la -10,0\ra$; distance traveled: $5\pi \approx 15.71$ft; average velocity: $\la -10/\pi,0\ra\approx \la -3.18,0\ra$; average speed: $5$ft/s
