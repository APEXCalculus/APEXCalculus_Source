{The functions $f(x) = \cos (2x)$ and $g(x) = \sin x$ intersect infinitely many times, forming an infinite number of repeated, enclosed regions. Find the areas of these regions.}
{On regions such as $[\pi/6,5\pi/6]$, the area is $3\sqrt{3}/2$. On regions such as $[-\pi/2,\pi/6]$, the area is $3\sqrt{3}/4$. }
