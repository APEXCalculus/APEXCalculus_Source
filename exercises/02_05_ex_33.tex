{The ``wind chill factor'' is a measurement of how cold it ``feels'' during cold, windy weather. Let $W(w)$ be the wind chill factor, in degrees Fahrenheit, when it is $25^\circ$F outside with a wind of $w$ mph. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		What are the units of $W'(w)$?
	\item		What would you expect the sign of $W'(10)$ to be?
	\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		$^\circ$ F/mph
\item		The sign would be negative; when the wind is blowing at 10 mph, any increase in wind speed will make it feel colder, i.e., a lower number on the Fahrenheit scale.
\end{enumerate}
}
