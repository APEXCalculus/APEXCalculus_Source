{The United States Postal Service charges more for boxes whose combined length and girth exceeds 108'' (the ``length'' of a package is the length of its longest side; the girth is the perimeter of the cross section, i.e., $2w+2h$). 

What is the maximum volume of a package with a square cross section ($w=h$) that does not exceed the 108'' standard? 
}
{The height and width should be $18$ and the length should be $36$, giving a volume of $11,664$in$^3$.
