{Explain how the vector $\vec v=\la 0.6,0.8, -2\ra$ can be thought of as having a ``slope'' of $-2$.
}
{
Answers will vary. Let $\vec u = \la 0.6,0.8\ra$; this is a unit vector. The displacement of the vector is one unit in the $\vec u$-direction and $-2$ units in the $z$-direction. In the plane containing the $z$-axis and the vector $\vec u$, the line parallel to $\vec v$ has slope $-2$.
