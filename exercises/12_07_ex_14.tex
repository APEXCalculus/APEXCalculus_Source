{$\ds f(x,y) = 5x-7y$, constrained to the region bounded by $y=x^2$ and $y=1$.
}
{The region has two ``corners'' at $(1,1)$ and $(-1,1)$.\\
Along $y=1$, there is no critical point.\\
Along $y=x^2$, there is a critical point at $(5/14,25/196)\approx (0.357,0.128) $.\\
The function $f$ itself has no critical points.
Checking the value of $f$ at the corners $(1,1)$, $(-1,1)$ and the critical point $(5/14,25/196)$, we find the absolute maximum is at $(5/14,25/196,25/28) \approx (0.357,0.128,0.893)$ and the absolute minimum is at $(-1,1,-12)$.
