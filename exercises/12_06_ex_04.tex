{Explain in your own words why we do not refer to \textit{the} tangent line to a surface at a point, but rather to \textit{directional} tangent line\textit{s} to a surface at a point.
}
{On a surface through a point, there are many different smooth curves, each with a tangent line at the point. Each of these tangent lines is also ``tangent'' to the surface. There is not just one tangent line, but many, each in a different direction. Therefore we refer to directional tangent lines, not just \textit{the} tangent line.
