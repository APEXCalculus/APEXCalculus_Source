{You are given the following information: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 1} f(x) = 0$
	\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 1} g(x) = 0$
	\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 1} f(x)/g(x) = 2$
	\end{enumerate}
What can be said about the relative sizes of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as $x$ approaches 1?	
}
{As $x$ is near 1, both $f$ and $g$ are near 0, but $f$ is approximately twice the size of $g$. (I.e., $f(x) \approx 2g(x)$.)
