{Find the maximum sum of two numbers, each of which is in $[0,300]$ whose product is 500.
}
{The only critical point of the fundamental equation corresponds to a minimum; to find maximum, we check the endpoints. 

If one number is 300, the other number $y$ satisfies $300y = 500$; $y = 5/3$. Thus the sum is $300+5/3$. 

The other endpoint, 0, is not feasible as we cannot solve $0\cdot y = 500$ for $y$. In fact, if $0<x<5/3$, then $x\cdot y = 500$ forces $y>300$, which is not a feasible solution. 

Hence the maximum sum is $301.\overline{6}$.
