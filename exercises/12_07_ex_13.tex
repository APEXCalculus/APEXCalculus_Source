{$\ds f(x,y) = x^2+y^2+y+1$, constrained to the triangle with vertices $(0,1)$, $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,-1)$.
}
{The triangle is bound by the lines $y=-1$, $y=2x+1$ and $y=-2x+1$.\\
Along $y=-1$, there is a critical point at $(0,-1)$.\\
Along $y=2x+1$, there is a critical point at $(-3/5,-1/5)$.\\
Along $y=-2x+1$, there is a critical point at $(3/5,-1/5)$.\\
The function $f$ has one critical point, irrespective of the constraint, at $(0,-1/2)$.\\
Checking the value of $f$ at these four points, along with the three vertices of the triangle, we find the absolute maximum is at $(0,1,3)$ and the absolute minimum is at $(0,-1/2,3/4)$.
