At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the side of the house when the base is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	1 foot from the house?
\item	10 feet from the house?
\item	23 feet from the house?
\item	24 feet from the house?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $0.04$ ft/s
\item	 $0.458$ ft/s
\item  $3.35$ ft/s
\item	Not defined; as the distance approaches 24, the rates approaches $\infty$.	
\end{enumerate}
