{Passes through $P=(5,1,9)$ and orthogonal to both\\ $\vec d_1=\la 1,0,1\ra$ and $\vec d_2=\la 2,0,3\ra$.
}
{Answers can vary; here the direction is given by $\vec d_1\times \vec d_2$:
vector: $\ell(t) = \la 5,1,9\ra + t\la 0,-1,0\ra$\\
parametric: $x= 5$, $y=1-t$, $z = 9$\\
symmetric: not defined, as some components of the direction are 0.
