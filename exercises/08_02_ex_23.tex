{Show the series $\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}$ diverges.
}
{Using partial fractions, we can show that $a_n = \frac14\left(\frac1{2n-1}+\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)$. The series is effectively twice the sum of the odd terms of the Harmonic Series which was shown to diverge in Exercise \ref{08_02_ex_24}. Thus this series diverges.
