At what rate is the boat approaching the dock when the boat is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	50 feet out?
\item	15 feet out?
\item	1 foot from the dock?
\item	What happens when the length of rope pulling in the boat is less than 10 feet long?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $30.59$ ft/min
\item	 $36.1$ ft/min
\item  $301$ ft/min
\item	 The boat no longer floats as usual, but is being pulled up by the winch (assuming it has the power to do so).	
\end{enumerate}
