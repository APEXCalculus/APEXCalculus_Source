{A hunter aims at a deer which is 40 yards away. Her crossbow is at a height of 5ft, and she aims for a spot on the deer 4ft above the ground. The crossbow fires her arrows at 300ft/s.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item At what angle of elevation should she hold the crossbow to hit her target?
	\item	If the deer is moving perpendicularly to her line of sight at a rate of 20mph, by approximately how much should she lead the deer in order to hit it in the desired location?
\end{enumerate} 
}
{\begin{enumerate}
	\item Holding the crossbow at an angle of $0.013$ radians, $\approx 0.745^\circ$ will hit the target $0.4$s later. (Another solution exists, with an angle of $89^\circ$, landing $18.75$s later, but this is impractical.)
	\item	In the .4 seconds the arrow travels, a deer, traveling at 20mph or 29.33ft/s, can travel 11.7ft. So she needs to lead the deer by 11.7ft.
\end{enumerate}
