{$\vrt = \la t,t^2 \ra$ on $[-1,1]$; consider $t=0$ and $t=1$.
}
{$a_{\text{T}} = \frac{4t}{\sqrt{1+4t^2}}$ and $a_{\text{N}} = \sqrt{4-\frac{16t^2}{1+4t^2}}$\\
At $t=0$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 2$;\\
At $t=1$, $a_{\text{T}} = 4/\sqrt{5}$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 2/\sqrt{5}$.\\
At $t=0$, all acceleration comes in the form of changing the direction of velocity and not the speed; at $t=1$, more acceleration comes in changing the speed than in changing direction.
