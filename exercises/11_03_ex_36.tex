{A baseball player hits a ball at 100mph, with an initial height of 3ft and an angle of elevation of $20^\circ$, at Boston's Fenway Park. The ball flies towards the famed ``Green Monster,'' a wall 37ft high located 310ft from home plate. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] Show that as hit, the ball hits the wall.
	\item [(b)] Show that if the angle of elevation is $21^\circ$, the ball clears the Green Monster.
\end{enumerate}
}
{The position function of the ball is $\vrt = \la (146.67\cos\theta)t,-16t^2+(146.67\sin\theta)t+3\ra$, where $\theta$ is the angle of elevation.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item With $\theta=20^\circ$, the ball reaches 310ft from home plate in 2.25 seconds; at this time, the height of the ball is 34.9ft, not enough to clear the Green Monster.
	\item	With $\theta=21^\circ$, the ball reaches 310ft from home plate in 2.26s, with a height of 40ft, clearing the wall.
\end{enumerate}
