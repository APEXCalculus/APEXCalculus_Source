{A rope of length $\ell$ ft hangs over the edge of tall cliff. (Assume the cliff is taller than the length of the rope.) The rope has a weight density of $d$ lb/ft.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		How much work is done pulling the entire rope to the top of the cliff?
	\item		What percentage of the total work is done pulling in the first half of the rope?
	\item		How much rope is pulled in when half of the total work is done?
	\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}
	\item 	$\frac12\cdot d\cdot l^2$ ft--lb
	\item		75 \%
	\item		$\ell(1-\sqrt{2}/2) \approx 0.2929\ell$
	\end{enumerate}
