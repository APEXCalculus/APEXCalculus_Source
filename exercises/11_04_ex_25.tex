{$\vrt = \la a\cos t,a\sin t, bt \ra$ on $[0,2\pi]$, where $a,b>0$; consider $t=0$ and $t=\pi/2$.

{$a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = a$\\
At $t=0$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = a$;\\
At $t=\pi/2$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = a$.\\
The object moves at constant speed, meaning that $a_{\text{T}}$ is always 0. The object ``rises'' along the $z$-axis at a constant rate, so all acceleration comes in the form of changing direction circling the $z$-axis. The greater the radius of this circle the greater the acceleration, hence $a_{\text{N}}=a$.
