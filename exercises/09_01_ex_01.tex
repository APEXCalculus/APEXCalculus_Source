{What is the difference between degenerate and nondegenerate conics?
}
{When defining the conics as the intersections of a plane and a double napped cone, degenerate conics are created when the plane intersects the tips of the cones (usually taken as the origin). Nondegenerate conics are formed when this plane does not contain the origin.
