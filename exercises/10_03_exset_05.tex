{\noindent In Exercises}
{, vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are given. Write $\vec u$ as the sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to $\vec v$ and one of which is perpendicular to $\vec v$. Note: these are the same pairs of vectors as found in Exercises \ref{ex:10_03_ex_21} -- \ref{ex:10_03_ex_24}.
