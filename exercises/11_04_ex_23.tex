{$\vrt = \la 2\cos t,2\sin t \ra$ on $[0,2\pi]$; consider $t=0$ and $t=\pi/2$.
}
{$a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 2$\\
At $t=0$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 2$;\\
At $t=\pi/2$, $a_{\text{T}} = 0$ and $a_{\text{N}} = 2$.\\
The object moves at constant speed, so all acceleration comes from changing direction, hence $a_{\text{T}}=0$. $\vat$ is always parallel to $\vec N(t)$, but twice as long, hence $a_{\text{N}}=2$.
