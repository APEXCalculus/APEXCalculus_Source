{Find $n$ such that the  Taylor polynomial of degree $n$ of $f(x)= \sqrt x$, centered at $x=4$, approximates $\sqrt 3$ within $0.0001$ of the actual value.
}
{The $n^\text{th}$ derivative of $f(x)=\sqrt x$ is bounded by $0.1$ on intervals containing $3$ and $4$. Thus $|R_n(\pi)|\leq \frac{0.1}{(n+1)!}(1)^{(n+1)}$. When $n=4$, this is less than $0.0001$.
