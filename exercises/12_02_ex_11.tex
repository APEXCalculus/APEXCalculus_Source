{$\ds \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} \frac{x+y}{x-y}$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Along the path $y=mx$.
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}
	\item Along $y=mx$, the limit is $\frac{m+1}{m-1}$.
\end{enumerate}
Since the above limit varies according to what $m$ is used, each limit is different, meaning the overall limit does not exist.
