{Consider the hyperbola given by $x^2-y^2=1$.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		Verify that the foci are located at $(\pm \sqrt{2},0)$.
	\item		The points $(2,\sqrt{3})$ and $(-\sqrt{17},4)$ lie on the hyperbola. Verify that the difference of distances from each point to the foci is the same.
	\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		$c=\sqrt{1+1}=\sqrt{2}$
\item		The difference is distances is 2 for each point.
\end{enumerate}
}
