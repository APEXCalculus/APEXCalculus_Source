{Show why if the point $Q$ lies in a plane, then the distance formula correctly gives the distance from the point to the plane as $0$.
}
{If $P$ is any point in the plane, and $Q$ is also in the plane, then $\vv{PQ}$ lies parallel to the plane and is orthogonal to $\vec n$, the normal vector. Thus $\vec n\cdot \vv{PQ}=0$, giving the distance as 0.
