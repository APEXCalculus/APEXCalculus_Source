{The object of this problem is to connect the Mean Value Theorem of Theorem \ref{thm:mvt} to the Mean Value Theorem of Theorem \ref{thm:mvt2}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		Let $F(x)$ be an antiderivative of $f(x)$. Therefore, what is $F'(c)$?
\item		Write Theorem \ref{thm:mvt} in terms of $F(x)$; that is, the theorem states that on $[a,b]$, there is a $c$ such that $F'(c) = $?
\item		Using your answer from above, what is $F'(c)(b-a)=$?
\item		Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in Theorem \ref{thm:FTC2}, write $F(b) -F(a)$ in terms of an integral of $f$.
\item		Rewrite the statement from (c) completely in terms of $f$ and comment on its relationship to the Mean Value Theorem of Theorem \ref{thm:mvt2}.
\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		$f(c)$
\item		$F'(c) = (F(b)-F(a))/(b-a)$
\item		$F(b) - F(a)$
\item		$\int_a^b f(x) \ dx$
\item		$f(c)(b-a) = \int_a^b f(x)\ dx$, which is the Mean Value Theorem.
\end{enumerate}
