{A crane lifts a 2,000 lb load vertically 30 ft with a 1'' cable weighing 1.68 lb/ft.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item		How much work is done lifting the cable alone?
	\item		How much work is done lifting the load alone?
	\item		Could one conclude that the work done lifting the cable is negligible compared to the work done lifting the load?
	\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item	756 ft--lb
\item	60,000 ft--lb
\item	Yes, for the cable accounts for about 1\% of the total work.
\end{enumerate}
